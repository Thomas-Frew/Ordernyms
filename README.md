Ordernyms is a game designed to help primary school students expand their vocabulary. Two players face-off in a fierce, synonym-ranking feud!

## Gameplay

Ordernyms is played over several rounds. Each player is provided with a sentence and five synonyms that could replace one of its words. They must rank these synonyms in order of appropriateness, from best to worst. 

Players receive points based on how similar their rankings are to those generated by Microsoft Word. Whoever earns more points wins the round. The first player to three wins is victorious!

## Interface

Ordernyms was originally designed to be played with a dedicated Ordernyms Controller (see below). However, a compatibility version has been uploaded to GitHub that does not require this hardware.
